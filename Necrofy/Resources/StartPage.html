		<h1>Welcome to Necrofy!</h1>
		<h2>Getting started</h2>
		<p>The first thing you'll need is a ROM for the USA (or [U]) version of the SNES release of Zombies Ate My Neighbors. Other versions are not supported. Once you have a ROM file, create a project with it from the <i>File</i> menu.</p>
		<h2>What is a project?</h2>
		<p>Unlike most ROM hacking tools, Necrofy does not edit the ROM file directly. You must first create a project from your "base ROM". A project is a folder on your computer that contains all of the data that can be modified for your hack. All of the necessary levels, graphics, palettes, etc. will be automatically extracted from the base ROM when the project is created. Once the files have been changed, you can then build the project, which will apply all of the files onto the base ROM and produce a playable game with your changes.</p>
		<p>In short, the project workflow looks like this:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a project from a base ROM</li>
			<li>Make changes to any levels, graphics, or other files in the project</li>
			<li>Build the project to create a playable ROM file</li>
			<li>Repeat steps 2-3</li>
		</ol>
		<p>This has several benefits, especially when working on more complex ROM hacks, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Makes it easy to track what parts of the game have been modified</li>
			<li>Enables hackers to collaborate by editing separate files</li>
			<li>Provides an easy way for external tools to edit certain parts of the game</li>
		</ul>
