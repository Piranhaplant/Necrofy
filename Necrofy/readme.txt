FAQ:

The program won't open.

	If you are using Windows 7, you will need to make sure you have
	at least version 4.7.1 of the Microsoft .NET Framework installed.

How do I open a ROM file?

    Necrofy does not open ROM files directly. You must first create a
	project, which will extract all the necessary data from the ROM.
	Then you edit the files within the project, and build it back into
	a ROM file to play.
